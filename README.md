# McDonald's Calorie Application

A basic graphing application created using python Flask and ChartJS.

This application uses Flask, Jinja2, CSV and ChartJS to read calorie information from the McDonald's menu CSV file and display it in a bar chart.

A fair amount of tidying up is required for this app to make it easier to read and comply to standard practices but currently it is fully functional.
